# Simple Email Obfuscator 

Protect your website from email-harvesting bots without compromising user experience. The Email Obfuscator automatically finds and transforms every email address on your Concrete CMS website into a format that's unreadable for spambots — making it much harder for malicious crawlers to scrape them.

Behind the scenes, email addresses are obfuscated using various encoding techniques, rendering them useless to automated tools. But don’t worry: when a real visitor loads your site, the JavaScript engine silently and instantly reverts the protected emails back to their original, human-readable form. No visual disruption, no usability trade-offs — just smart, invisible protection.

Whether you're running a blog, a portfolio, or a business site, Email Obfuscator gives you a simple yet powerful way to safeguard contact info and maintain professionalism. Easy to install, no manual configuration needed.
